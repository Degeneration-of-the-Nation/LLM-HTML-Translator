# Multilingual HTML Translator

A sophisticated Python tool for translating complex HTML websites while preserving structure and literary quality. Uses Anthropic's Claude AI for high-quality translations with advanced context handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Project Background

This tool was originally developed to translate [The Degeneration of the Nation](https://degeneration-of-nation.org) - a unique philosophical and cultural website exploring the intersection of technology, artificial intelligence, and human culture. The original Hebrew website [התדרדרות הארץ](https://hitdarderut-haaretz.org) features:

- Complex philosophical essays on AI, technology, and culture
- Experimental literature and interactive books, including branching narratives
- Extensive cultural and technological analysis

## Implementation & Scope

The tool currently powers translations for multiple language editions:

- [Hebrew Edition](https://hitdarderut-haaretz.org)
- [English Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/en/)
- [French Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/fr/)
- [Japanese Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/ja/)
- [Russian Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/ru/)
- [Korean Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/ko/)
- [Mandarin Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/zh/)
- [German Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/de/)
- [Spanish Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/es/)
- [Portuguese Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/pt/)
- [Italian Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/it/)
- [Hindi Edition](https://degeneration-of-nation.org/hi/)

Current scope includes:
- 600,000+ words of original content
- 400+ articles and essays
- 10+ books
- Multiple experimental literary works
